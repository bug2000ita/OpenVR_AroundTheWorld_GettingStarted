## Welcome to Open VR AROUND THE WORLD

We are building and learning together great things :)

This is my idea, if you have a better idea or you woudl like to help in it ... let's coding !

## Atom’s puzzle (Project Story)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1toSxQg9pg0R6FRh5Qbs14Knyl_Cdt0_v8whNw2G-3yU/edit

The user should be able to “walk” inside a VR “museum” , finding under some small domes (open google doc in the prev link) the 3d model of an atom. The user has to resolve some puzzles before to open it and collect the atoms inside it.
Then the collected atoms can be used to play with that, create molecules and resolve other puzzle.

## We need:

<br>Integrate Vive Headset and controllers (DONE)
<br>Create the museo environment
<br>Engine for teleporting (walking)
<br>Be able to touch and grab, launch things
<br>Ideas for creating Puzzles
<br>Create an inventary where to save collected atoms :)
<br>….add your ideas :)
