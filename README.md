## Welcome to Open VR AROUND THE WORLD

We are building and learning together great things :)

This is my idea, if you have a better idea or you woudl like to help in it ... let's coding !

## Atom’s puzzle (Project Story)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1toSxQg9pg0R6FRh5Qbs14Knyl_Cdt0_v8whNw2G-3yU/edit

The user should be able to “walk” inside a VR “museum” , finding under some small domes (open google doc in the prev link) containing the 3d model of an atom or some puzzle to be solved. The collected atoms will unlock secret rooms of the museum. 
We could name this application / game : "Day at the Museum",

## We need:

<br>Integrate Vive Headset and controllers (DONE)
<br>Create the museo environment
<br>Engine for teleporting (walking) (DONE)
<br>Be able to touch and grab, launch things
<br>Ideas for creating Puzzles
<br>Create an inventary (bag...) :)
<br>….add your ideas :)
